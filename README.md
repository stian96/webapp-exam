## About This Project
This project has been developed as a part of the exam in web applications 2023 and represents extensive 
work in React and Next.js. The project consist of three main parts:

- **First Assignment**: An interactive application to help children with math tasks.
- **Second Assignment**: A system for monitoring and managing training sessions for athletes.
- **Third Assignment**: Improvement and documentation of an existing, incomplete codebase.

## Project Status

This project has now been completed as part of the exam in web applications 2023. Given a tight time frame of only four weeks, 
we focused primarily on developing and implementing core functionalities. While we are happy with what we have achieved under these 
constraints, there are several aspects we would improve with more time for assignment 2:
- Unit tests.
- Code refactoring.
- Refinement of the User Interfaces.
